## Overview

CommuneDrop is a comprehensive delivery tracking platform built with a modern microservice architecture. The platform enables real-time delivery tracking, secure payment processing, and efficient order management through a set of specialized microservices deployed on AWS EKS.

## System Architecture

CommuneDrop is built on a robust microservice architecture with the following components:

### Microservices

| Service                 | Technology Stack                              | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AuthService**         | .NET, Duende Identity Server, MongoDB         | Authentication and authorization for all microservices |
| **Frontend Service**    | React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Socket.IO           | User interface and service coordination                |
| **LiveLocationService** | Node.js, Socket.IO, Kafka, MongoDB            | Real-time driver location tracking                     |
| **LocationService**     | Node.js, Express, AWS Location, Redis         | Geocoding and route calculation                        |
| **OrderService**        | Node.js, TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Kafka  | Order management and status tracking                   |
| **PaymentService**      | Node.js, TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Stripe | Payment processing and refund management               |

### Communication Flow

1. **Authentication**: All services authenticate through AuthService using OAuth2/OpenID Connect
2. **Order Creation**: Users create orders through the Frontend, which are processed by OrderService
3. **Payment Processing**: PaymentService handles secure payment transactions via Stripe
4. **Location Tracking**: LiveLocationService provides real-time driver location updates via Kafka and WebSockets
5. **Route Calculation**: LocationService calculates optimal routes and delivery estimates

## AuthService

A .NET-based authentication service built as a Duende Identity Server for microservice authorization.

**Key Features:**

- User Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-Based Authentication
- OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Support
- Scope-Based Access Control
- Secure Password Hashing

## Frontend Service

React-based user interface that coordinates communication between all microservices.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time delivery tracking on maps
- Live notifications for order updates
- Secure payment processing
- Order history and delivery estimates
- Service-to-Service Authentication with OAuth tokens

## LiveLocationService

Provides real-time location tracking between drivers and customers.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time Driver Location Tracking via WebSockets
- Order Notification System
- Bi-directional Communication
- Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka
- Geospatial queries for nearby driver discovery

## LocationService

Provides geocoding, route calculation, and location-based services.

**Key Features:**

- Address Geocoding
- Route Calculation with AWS Location Services
- Detailed Route Information
- Address Autocomplete
- Efficient Redis Caching

## OrderService

Manages delivery orders, status tracking, and payment processing.

**Key Features:**

- Order Creation
- Payment Processing
- Order Status Management
- Pricing Calculation
- Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka

## PaymentService

Handles all payment-related operations through Stripe integration.

**Key Features:**

- Customer Management
- Payment Method Handling
- Payment Processing
- Refund Management
- Order Status Updates

## Infrastructure as Code

The entire infrastructure is provisioned and managed using Terraform, enabling consistent, version-controlled deployment across environments.

### AWS EKS Cluster

The platform runs on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with the following components:

- **VPC Configuration**:

  - Custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
  - Internet Gateway for public access
  - NAT Gateway for private subnet outbound traffic
  - Security groups with appropriate ingress/egress rules

- **EKS Cluster**:

  - Kubernetes version 1.27
  - OIDC provider for service account IAM roles
  - Cluster logging enabled for audit and troubleshooting

- **Node Groups**:

  - Spot instances for cost optimization (t3.medium)
  - Auto-scaling configuration (1-3 nodes)
  - IAM roles with necessary permissions

- **Load Balancing**:
  - AWS Load Balancer Controller for ingress management
  - Automatic provisioning of Application Load Balancers
  - SSL/TLS termination support

### Kubernetes Resources

The `/Infrastructure/Kubernetes` directory contains:

- `egress-configuration.yaml`: Outbound traffic rules
- `ingress-commune-drop-configuration.yaml`: Ingress rules for the main application
- `ingress-live-location-configuration.yaml`: Ingress rules for the location service

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform CLI
- kubectl
- Helm

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smangukia/CommuneDrop.git
cd CommuneDrop
```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

```shellscript
cd Infrastructure
terraform init
```

3. **Apply Terraform configuration**

```shellscript
terraform apply
```

4. **Configure kubectl**

```shellscript
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eks-cluster --region us-east-1
```

5. **Deploy microservices**

```shellscript
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/
```

6. **Verify deployment**

```shellscript
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

## Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies

- **.NET Core**: Powers the AuthService with Duende Identity Server
- **Node.js**: Foundation for most microservices
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js services
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for robust applications
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- **Redis**: In-memory caching for LocationService
- **Kafka**: Event streaming platform for real-time updates
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication

### Frontend Technologies

- **React**: UI library for building the user interface
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Google Maps API**: Map visualization for location tracking
- **Supabase**: Authentication and database services

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization of all services
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for deployment
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for cloud resources
- **AWS Services**:

- Amazon EKS
- VPC and networking components
- Load Balancer Controller
- IAM roles and policies

### Security

- **OAuth2 & OpenID Connect**: Industry-standard authentication protocols
- **JWT**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Stripe**: PCI-compliant payment processing

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Kubernetes Dashboard**: Visual management of cluster resources
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Metrics and logging
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Advanced monitoring (planned)

## Security Considerations

- All services use JWT-based authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- API endpoints are protected with appropriate scopes
- Payment information is handled securely through Stripe
- Private subnets for sensitive workloads
- Security groups with least privilege access
